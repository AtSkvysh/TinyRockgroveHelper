# TinyRockgroveHelper
Timer for Bitter Marrow (portal debuff) tick during Bahsei HM fight in Rockgrove.

## Features
The addon adds a count-down timer that is only active while you're in portal during Bahsei HM fight. When the timer hits 0, you take damage from portal's DoT. [You can see a timer example here, simulated with entropy.](https://giant.gfycat.com/InferiorAliveCaracal.mp4) This allows  you to know when you can safely exit mistform to light attack a wraith or beam without taking damage instantly.

## Installation
Clone the repository or use the latest [release](https://github.com/AtSkvysh/TinyRockgroveHelper/releases/tag/v1.0) and install as usual.

### Dependencies
There are no dependencies.

## Usage
Use `/script TinyRockgroveHelper.UnlockPanel()` to show/hide the timer to move it around.

## Disclaimer
The addon's feature might eventually be merged with [qCell's Rockgrove Helper](https://esoui.com/downloads/info3060-QcellsRockgroveHelper.html). When that happens, do remember to remove this addon.
